# Parcel Preact Kit

To start development you'll need to install dependencies via `yarn` or `npm i`.

Then type `yarn start` or `npm start` to start development server on 8080 port with [hot module replacement](https://en.parceljs.org/hmr.html) and other great stuff.

To bundle your application for production (will be generated `_./build` folder) just type`yarn build`or`npm run build`.

**Don't forget to change public URL in `package.json` scripts.**
